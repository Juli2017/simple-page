# Ten Years of Change in San Mateo County: 2006-2016  
"The Bay Area’s information-technology sector is gaining workers and wealth much faster even than the nation. But perhaps improbably, it is less-populous and -prominent San Mateo County, long squashed between its rivalrous county siblings, that emerges as poster child of swift change. Employment in its IT sector grew nearly 52 percent over five years, and the sector’s payroll almost tripled, expanding from $3.3 billion in 2009 to $11.8 billion in 2013, according to Census Bureau data."

San Mateo County is geographically diverse with coastal areas differing from inland areas. Between 2010 and 2014, San Mateo County added 54,600 new jobs, but only added 2,200 new housing units. As a result, San Mateo County is tied with San Francisco and Marin Counties for having the highest rental costs in the U.S. The rapid growth of the IT sector is having a profound affect on the the daily lives of San Mateo County residents.  The jobs/housing imbalance along with growing income inequality and increasing use of foreign workers in the IT sector can make it feel like a zero-sum game with winners and losers. A recent poll showed that 40% of Bay Area residents are now wanting to leave the area.

Click between the different statistics to see the variation among zip codes in population density, median household income, or housing costs (GRAPI or SMOCAPI).  

Two metrics in the American Community Survey indicate the portion of income spent on housing by both renters and homeowners with a mortgage: 

* GRAPI: GROSS RENT AS A PERCENTAGE OF HOUSEHOLD INCOME    
* SMOCAPI: SELECTED MONTHLY OWNER COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF HOUSEHOLD INCOME.   

The highest category tracked by the ACS is for people spending 35% or more of their income on housing and the fraction of renter and mortgage paying households in this category is shown on the map above using 2014 ACS data. Purple-shaded zip code polygons indicate that over 50% of the renter or mortgage-paying households are paying at least 35% of their income on housing.
