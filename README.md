Click between the different statistics to see the variation among zip codes in population density, median household income, or housing costs (GRAPI or SMOCAPI).  

San Mateo County is geographically diverse with coastal areas differing from inland areas. Between 2010 and 2014, San Mateo County added 54,600 new jobs, many of them in the tech sector, but only added 2,200 new housing units. As a result, San Mateo County is tied with San Francisco and Marin Counties for having the highest rental costs in the U.S. Two metrics in the American Community Survey indicate the portion of income spent on housing by both renters and homeowners with a mortgage: 

* GRAPI: GROSS RENT AS A PERCENTAGE OF HOUSEHOLD INCOME    
* SMOCAPI: SELECTED MONTHLY OWNER COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF HOUSEHOLD INCOME.   

The highest category tracked by the ACS is for people spending 35% or more of their income on housing and the fraction of renter and mortgage paying households in this category is shown on the map above using 2014 ACS data. Purple-shaded zip code polygons indicate that over 50% of the renter or mortgage-paying households are paying at least 35% of their income on housing.
